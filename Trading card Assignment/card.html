								<p>The belief that a rabbit's foot could be charmed, and therefore help one lead a charmed life, began as an offshoot of totemism. 
									This belief in a spiritual connection between humans and other living beings dates back thousands of years. 
									A tribe that considered itself descended from hares or rabbits worshiped the animals and carried parts of them for luck. 
									The foot was particularly lucky; it was a phallic symbol, a totem that represented not only good fortune, but also increased fertility and a bountiful harvest.</p></body></div>
