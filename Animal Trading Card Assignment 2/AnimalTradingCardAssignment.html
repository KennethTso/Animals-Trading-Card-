 <p>Cony looks really adorable, she is bad-tempered and always punishes her friends in a harsh way such as punching them and beating them up (especially Moon) when she goes bananas.<br> 
However, she is being kind and gentle to Brown most of the time. Also, she is a glutton and this nature always causes her to fail to burn her fat.<br>
 On the other hand,nonetheless, she doesn't have very high confidence and she has to give herself some makeup to become more beautiful.</p>
